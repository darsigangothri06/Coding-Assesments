// Raju was a problem on hand where he has an array which consists of n integers. 
// He wants ot find out the number of different arrays he can obtain from the array by applying the following operations exactly `K` times.

// The main idea is to pick some element in the array and multiply it by `-1`

// ```
// Input: 
// arr = [1,2,1]
// k = 1
// Output: 3
// ```
