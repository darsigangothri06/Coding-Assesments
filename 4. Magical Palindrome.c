// Consider the string `madam` which is called a palindrome string from left to right.
// In the same way you are given a string representation of a number and a maximum number of changes you can make.

// After the string, one digit at a time, to create the string representation of the largest number possible given the limit to the number of changes.

// The length of the string may not be altered, so you must consider's left of all higher digits in your tests.


// Given a string representing the starting number, and a maximum number of changes allowed, create the largest palindromic string of digits possible or the string `'-1'` if it not possible to create a palindrome under the constraints.

// Example:

// ```
// st = '1231'
// k = 3

// Make 3 replacements to get '9339'
// ```
